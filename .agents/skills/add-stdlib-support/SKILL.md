# Adding a New Standard Library Package

End-to-end workflow for porting a `ballerina/<name>` package from jBallerina (Java) into this repo. Follow the gates in order. Do not skip the approval gates (4 and 6).

All coding rules and the PAL constraint live in `AGENTS.md` at the repo root — read it before implementing. This skill encodes the *process*, not the rules.

If the user wants to fix a gap in a stdlib that already exists under `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<name>/`, use `fill-stdlib-gap` instead — this skill is heavyweight by design.

## 1. Acquire the jBallerina reference

Ask the user for the path to the corresponding jBallerina **library implementation root**, e.g. `~/github/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-<name>/`. Do not proceed without it.

That root should contain:

- `ballerina/` — the Ballerina-side source (public API, type declarations, extern function signatures).
- `native/` *(optional)* — the Java native implementation backing the extern functions. Pure-Ballerina libraries do not have this directory; that's fine, just note it.

Then:

- Read every `.bal` file under `<root>/ballerina/`, excluding `tests/` and `build/`, to enumerate the full jBallerina feature set and identify which functions are `external`.
- If `<root>/native/` exists, read the Java sources backing those extern functions. This is the authoritative source of truth for runtime semantics — error wording, edge-case handling, parsing rules, numeric behaviour — and is what the Go natives must match for parity (see Step 5). Don't infer behaviour from `.bal` signatures alone when Java source is available.

## 2. Resolve imports and check existing stdlib coverage

Scan the jBallerina source for `import ballerina/<X>` statements.

- For each `<X>` **not** already present under `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<X>/`: tell the user that dependency must be implemented first. If they ask to continue anyway, narrow the plan to only features that don't depend on `<X>`.
- For each `<X>` already present under `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<X>/`: read `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<X>/0.0.1/go1.2/README.md` and note every row whose status is **Not Yet Supported**, **Partially Supported**, or **Cannot Support**, plus anything under **Notable Behavioural Changes**. If our in-scope features depend on any of those gaps or divergences, surface them in the plan (Step 4) under a **Dependency Limitations** section.
- **Exception**: `ballerina/jballerina.java.arrays` will not get a Go equivalent. Plan to replace its uses with Go-native equivalents inside the `native/` layer.
- **Cross-stdlib import warning**: the current `builtinStdlibs` list in `test_util/testphases/phases.go` notes that builtins are "compiled with no imports of their own, so order is irrelevant." If the new package would import another stdlib (the first to do so), flag this to the user — the test loader may need updating to compile dependencies in order.

Do not silently drop features because of a missing import or inherited dependency gap — always flag and confirm.

## 3. Cross-check language support

Read `AGENTS.md` (root) in full, especially the **Interpreter stages** and **Coding style** sections. If a planned feature uses a construct known to fail in this interpreter (`distinct` error subtypes, `readonly &` intersections, `stream` type, XML, full `typedesc` parameter handling), drop or defer the feature and note it in the plan.

### Handling unexpected compile failures during implementation

When the interpreter panics or emits compile errors that are **not explained** by `AGENTS.md`, stop and present the developer with these options — **do not silently pick one**:

> **Unexpected language limitation found:** `<construct>` is not supported (`panic: <message>`).
>
> Options:
> 1. **Fix the interpreter** — implement this construct in the compiler/BIR pipeline. Requires a separate change.
> 2. **Work around in Ballerina** — rewrite the Ballerina source to avoid the construct.
> 3. **Move to Go native** — replace the Ballerina function body with `= external` and implement the logic in `native/`.
> 4. **Scope out this feature** — mark it `Not Yet Supported` in the README and move on.
>
> Which option do you prefer?

After the developer responds, apply the chosen resolution before continuing.

## 4. Propose a plan and a showcase `.bal` file *(GATE: wait for user approval)*

Produce both:

- **Plan** — a list of features in scope for this iteration, with explicit "Not Yet Supported" notes for anything left out. Include a **Dependency Limitations** section listing any inherited gaps from the README of every `ballerina/<X>` package we import (per Step 2).
- **Showcase `.bal` file** — a small program that exercises every feature in scope end-to-end. Use `@output` markers for expected output.

**Wait for the user to approve both the plan and the showcase file before touching any Go code.**

## 5. Behavioral parity analysis *(GATE: parity table required)*

The Go-native behaviour **must match the jBallerina (JVM) behaviour** for every supported feature. Users migrating from jBallerina must not observe breaking changes. Before writing any Go code, produce a parity table for each in-scope feature:

| Feature | Known Go/JVM divergence risk | Avoidable? | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Areas to investigate for every stdlib port

- **Decimal/floating-point precision** — Ballerina `decimal` maps to `java.math.BigDecimal` on the JVM. Verify Go preserves the same precision, rounding mode, and string representation.
- **String encoding** — Java uses UTF-16 internally; Go uses UTF-8. Check whether string operations (length, indexing, formatting) can produce different output for non-ASCII input.
- **Error messages** — Differences in the *underlying* exception/error text between Java and Go are **acceptable**. The **outer Ballerina error message and error type** must stay consistent; the text of `error:Cause` (the raw Java/Go error) may diverge.
- **Numeric overflow and edge cases** — Verify min/max values, overflow semantics, and NaN/Infinity handling against the jBallerina reference.
- **Module-specific risks** — each domain has its own divergence hot-spots; see the examples below.

### Domain-specific risks (time module example)

- RFC 3339 / RFC 5322 parsing edge cases (trailing spaces, lowercase `z`, sub-second precision beyond 9 digits).
- `utcToEmailString` zone representation (e.g., `"0"` → `"GMT"` in jBallerina).
- Sub-second precision in `utcToString` / `civilToString`.
- Leap second handling — Java's `java.time` and Go's `time` package model these differently.
- Timezone data source — Java ships IANA zone DB; Go uses OS-supplied or embedded `tzdata`.
- `monotonicNow()` epoch — explicitly "unspecified epoch"; a divergence here is acceptable, document it.

### Rules

- **Avoidable** divergences (resolvable in the Go layer) — fix before merging.
- **Unavoidable** divergences (architectural Go/JVM constraint) — record in the README under **Notable Behavioural Changes** *before* implementing.
- Do not proceed to Step 6 without a complete parity table, even if every row says "No risk identified."

## 6. Evaluate Go libraries *(GATE: wait for approval before touching `go.mod`)*

Only if external Go dependencies are needed. For each external functionality, evaluate 2–3 candidate Go libraries on:

| Axis | What to check |
|---|---|
| Availability | Active maintenance, last release within ~12 months, owner responsive |
| Licensing | Prefer MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD. **Flag GPL/AGPL/LGPL** — needs explicit user sign-off |
| Stability | v1.x+, release cadence, open-issue health |
| Dependency footprint | Transitive dep count, binary-size impact, CGo |

Present as a small table with a recommendation. **Wait for user approval** before adding the dependency to `go.mod`. If no external deps are needed, skip this step.

## 7. Implement

### File layout

```
lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<name>/0.0.1/go1.2/
├── Ballerina.toml          # package manifest
├── Bala.toml               # build/platform manifest
├── Dependencies.toml       # package dependencies
├── README.md               # via stdlib-readme-format skill
├── <name>.bal              # public API surface
└── native/                 # OPTIONAL — omit if pure Ballerina
    └── <name>.go           # Go native implementations
```

Multi-file `.bal` and multi-file `native/` are both supported — see exemplars below. For dotted names like `math.vector`, the single `.bal` file is named `math.vector.bal`.

### Manifest templates

**`Ballerina.toml`**:
```toml
[package]
org     = "ballerina"
name    = "<name>"
version = "0.0.1"
```

**`Bala.toml`**:
```toml
[bala]
schema_version = "4"

[build]
ballerina_version      = ""
implementation_vendor  = "WSO2"
language_spec_version  = "2024R1"
platform               = "go1.2"

[[modules]]
name   = "<name>"
export = true
```

**`Dependencies.toml`**:
```toml
[ballerina]
dependencies-toml-version = "2"

[[package]]
org     = "ballerina"
name    = "<name>"
version = "0.0.1"
```

### `.bal` template (license header — required on every `.bal` file)

### `native/<name>.go` template

```go
// Copyright (c) 2026, WSO2 LLC. (http://www.wso2.com).
// [...full Apache 2.0 header...]

package native

import (
    "ballerina-lang-go/runtime"
    "ballerina-lang-go/runtime/extern"
    "ballerina-lang-go/values"
)

const (
    orgName    = "ballerina"
    moduleName = "<name>"
)

func externFnExtern(rt *runtime.Runtime) extern.NativeFunc {
    return func(_ *extern.Context, args []values.BalValue) (values.BalValue, error) {
        // implementation
        return nil, nil
    }
}

func init<Name>Module(rt *runtime.Runtime) {
    runtime.RegisterExternFunction(rt, orgName, moduleName, "externFn", externFnExtern(rt))
}

func init() {
    runtime.RegisterModuleInitializer(init<Name>Module)
}
```

### PAL hookup (if needed)

**PAL constraint**: every platform interaction (io, http, fs, env, time) must go through the Platform Adaptation Layer, never the underlying Go stdlib directly. If the relevant PAL method doesn't exist, add it across three files:

1. **`platform/pal/platform.go`** — add new fields to the relevant struct (`IO`, `Time`, `FS`, `HTTP`, `OS`) or define a new struct if no existing category fits.
2. **`platform/palnative/`** — implement every new PAL field for the CLI build. Place FS methods in `fs.go`, OS methods in `os.go`, etc. If `test_util` needs to share the implementation, export `NewNative<Category>PAL()` so it can be called from there.
3. **`test_util/test_util.go` → `TestPal`** — wire new fields in. Safest pattern: start from `palnative.NewNative<Category>PAL()` and override only the test-specific fields. Failing to update `TestPal` causes nil-pointer dereferences in corpus tests even when the CLI run succeeds.

### Wire-up checklist *(every new stdlib — missing any = silent failure)*

1. **`lib/rt/libs.go`** — add a blank import so the `init()` in the native package runs at binary start:
   ```go
   _ "ballerina-lang-go/lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<name>/0.0.1/go1.2/native"
   ```
   Without this, all `= external` functions produce "function not found" at runtime even though the binary compiles cleanly. Skip this line if your stdlib has no `native/` directory.

2. **`test_util/testphases/phases.go`** — append an entry to `builtinStdlibs`:
   ```go
   {"ballerina", "<name>", "0.0.1"},
   ```
   Without this, corpus tests cannot resolve `import ballerina/<name>` even if everything else compiles.

3. **`projects/module_resolver.go`** — usually no change. The existing `packageNameCandidates` handles dotted names (`math.vector` → tries `math.vector` then `math`). Read it once to confirm the import in question is covered.

### Coding rules to honor (full list in `AGENTS.md`)

- Don't make symbols public unless asked or needed.
- License header on every `.bal` and `.go` file.
- No per-line comments — if a block needs explanation, extract a named function.
- When multiple structs share fields and methods, use a private `*Base` struct with type inclusion.
- Never store `model.Symbol` as a map key — always `model.SymbolRef`.
- Don't call operations on symbols directly — go through the compiler context.

### Canonical exemplars in this repo

| Exemplar | Use when |
|---|---|
| `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/url/0.0.1/go1.2/` | Smallest viable stdlib — 2 extern functions, 1 native file. |
| `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/io/0.0.1/go1.2/` | Multi-file `.bal` (constants/types/print/file) + multi-file `native/` (`io.go` + `file_io.go`). |
| `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/time/0.0.1/go1.2/` | Heavy native implementation with PAL usage and documented behavioural divergences. |
| `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/http/0.0.1/go1.2/` | Class-based stdlib (Client init wrapper). |
| `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/math.vector/0.0.1/go1.2/` | Pure Ballerina — no `native/` directory at all. |

## 8. Tests

Add corpus tests under `corpus/bal/subset8/<NN>-<name>/`, where `<NN>` is the next free 2-digit prefix in that directory. Targeting **≥80% coverage** of the new Go code under `native/`.

- Suffixes per `AGENTS.md`: `*-v.bal` (valid, end-to-end with `@output` markers), `*-e.bal` (compile-time errors, `@error` markers), `*-p.bal` (runtime panics, `@panic` markers), `*-f{v|e|p}.bal` (future, scope-deferred).
- Name files **without leading zeros** in numeric parts (e.g. `print1-v.bal`, not `print01-v.bal`).
- Hand off golden-file regeneration to the **`update-corpus-tests`** skill:
  ```shell
  go test ./corpus --update
  ```
  Then review `git diff corpus/` before committing.

## 9. README

Author `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<name>/0.0.1/go1.2/README.md` using the **`stdlib-readme-format`** skill. Load that skill now and run its validation checklist before saving the file. Copy every unavoidable divergence from the Step 5 parity table into **Notable Behavioural Changes** — these must be present before merge.

Then update the top-level aggregator `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/README.md` (same `stdlib-readme-format` skill): add the new package row (alphabetical), recompute the **Total** footer, and mirror this package's behavioural changes into a `### <name>` subsection (only if it has any).

## 10. Verify

Before declaring done, check every box:

### Code
- [ ] `go build ./...` — no compilation errors.
- [ ] `go vet ./...` — no vet warnings.

### Tests
- [ ] `go test ./corpus/...` — all corpus tests pass.
- [ ] `go run ./cli/cmd run <showcase>.bal` (or `./bal run <showcase>.bal` if the binary is built) — output matches the `@output` markers exactly.
- [ ] `git diff corpus/` reviewed; every regenerated golden-file line is intentional.
- [ ] New corpus test files follow naming (no leading zeros, correct suffix).

### Parity
- [ ] Every Step 5 parity-table row marked **"Avoidable / Fixed"** manually verified against jBallerina for at least one representative input.
- [ ] Every unavoidable divergence recorded in **Notable Behavioural Changes**.

### Documentation
- [ ] `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/<name>/0.0.1/go1.2/README.md` support table reflects current implementation (no stale `Not Yet Supported` rows for things just implemented).
- [ ] `lib/stdlibs/ballerina/README.md` aggregator updated (new row, recomputed Total footer, behavioural changes mirrored).
- [ ] `stdlib-readme-format` validation checklist passes.

### Wire-up
- [ ] `lib/rt/libs.go` blank import added (skip only if pure Ballerina).
- [ ] `test_util/testphases/phases.go` `builtinStdlibs` entry added.
- [ ] PAL fields (if any added) implemented in `palnative/` and wired into `TestPal`.

### Final report

Summarise:
- What was implemented and what was scoped out (with reasons).
- Any new PAL methods or external Go dependencies added.
- The complete parity table from Step 5.
